Cloth	Frostweave Cloth	#6d9eeb													
			Bolt of Frostweave												
				Crafted	Bolt of Frostweave	~	~	Tailoring	FALSE	Phase 1	0	5 Frostweave Cloth per Bolt			Cloth, Frostweave Cloth
			Bolt of Imbued Frostweave												
				Crafted	Bolt of Imbued Frostweave	~	~	Tailoring	FALSE	Phase 1	0	2 Bolts of Frostweave, 2 Infinite Dust per Imbued Bolt			Cloth, Bolt of Frostweave; Enchanting, Infinite Dust
			Ebonweave												
				Crafted	Ebonweave	44.76, 52.03	Dragonblight	Tailoring	FALSE	Phase 1	0	4 day cooldown. Requires the Obsidian Dragonshrine. Specialised tailors again make two instead of one. Shadoweave Tailors are automatically grandfathered into Ebonweave!	38.43, 32.68		
			Eternium Thread												
				Sold	Any Tailoring supplier	~	~	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Any supplier will provide you with this. Don't you think it's weird that every tailor, some of whom never left Northrend, quickly adapted to using threads made of a metal that only occurs in Outland?			
			Frostweave Cloth												
				Drop	Virtually any humanoid / undead in Northrend	~	Any	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Pick any target you can comfortably kill and go to town. Highly skilled Tailors can learn to scavenge significantly more cloth when they loot a monster.			
				Fished	Reinforced Crate	~	Any	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Comes from any swarm of fish, ironically enough. Has an average of 5 Cloth 11% of the time.			
				Container	Abandoned Adventurer's Satchel	~	Any	~	FALSE	Phase 1	4	Guaranteed drop from any rare mob which seems to always contain a 20 stack of cloth. Decent enough, but they're by definition hard to find and can be quite tough.			
			Iceweb Spider Silk												
				Drop	Dread Creeper, Venom Stalker, Carrion Spinner	58.22, 58.22	Naxxramas	Group	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Just as they obsoleted silk demand in Classic so do I expect will they do again. Your guild will likely provide these freely.	87.13, 51.25		
				Drop	Trapdoor Crawler	65.23, 42.31	Zul'Drak	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	In contrast to the Trapdoor Ambusher to the south, not relevant to any quest, can freely be spawned, and is only an annoyance to average people.		35.0, 47.60; 35.0, 57.6; 39.0, 57.6; 39.0, 47.6	
				Drop	Crystalweb Spiders	57.34, 36.01	Storm Peaks	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Relevant to one quest, but plentiful.		40.6, 74.4; 46.6, 73.4; 40.6, 77.4; 40.2, 75.6	
				Drop	Trapdoor Ambusher	67.20, 49.89	Zul'Drak	Quest	FALSE	Phase 1	3	Only spawn by interacting during the daily quest Troll Patrol: Can You Dig It?, and messing around for long ruins your time for the meta-daily.		44.6, 83.4; 51.0, 86.8; 46.8, 80.2; 45.0, 81.6	
			Moonshroud												
				Crafted	Moonshroud	51.76, 64.58	Dragonblight	Tailoring	FALSE	Phase 1	0	4 day cooldown. Requires the Emerald Dragonshrine. Specialised tailors again make two instead of one. Mooncloth Tailors are automatically grandfathered into Moonshroud!	63.67, 73.18		
			Spellweave												
				Crafted	Spellweave	48.70, 63.18	Dragonblight	Tailoring	FALSE	Phase 1	0	4 day cooldown. Requires the Azure Dragonshrine. Specialised tailors again make two instead of one. Spellfire Tailors are automatically grandfathered into Spellweave!	55.30, 65.83		
Elemental	Crystallized Fire	#FF0000													
			Crystallized Air												
				Drop	Enraged Tempest	20.07, 52.54	Borean Tundra	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Hyperspawn, compact, easy to kill, give movement speed buff on kill. What's not to like.		42.0 8.2; 45.4 6.8; 46.0 7.4; 46.0 10.6; 44.4 11.6; 42.2 9.8	
				Drop	Scion of Storm	65.23, 21.42	Storm Peaks	~	TRUE	Phase 1	2	Though quest-relevant, there are dozens of these in a tiny cave including a literal shooting gallery. Their sheer quality makes up for a 25% chance of 1-2 Airs		64.2 42.2; 67.2 40.0; 69.6 41.6; 67.8 44.6; 64.6 44.2	
				Drop	Stormrider	52.51, 24.67	Storm Peaks	~	TRUE	Phase 1	1	Large area with mobs just about in range of each other. Less compact than Scion of Storm but also plentiful.		25.6 37.6; 28.2 43.4; 29.0 48.4; 32.0 47.2; 32.0 47.2; 31.6 49.6; 28.6 51.0; 24.4 39.4	
				Drop	Tempest Revenant	39.79, 52.85	Lake Wintergrasp	~	FALSE	Phase 1	4	Only visible if your faction holds Wintergrasp. Drop rates are pretty bad, plus they are in a mandatory PvP zone and pack a good punch.		61.0 83.6; 63.0 73.8; 74.4 73.8; 78.6 85.6; 63.0 86.4|27.6 69.0; 42.6 70.0; 45.0 82.6	
				Drop	Altar Warden	74.34, 43.15	Zul'Drak	~	FALSE	Phase 1	3	With a little questing, you can turn all mobs here neutral. But there aren't many of these and the quest often requires a full clear, leading to high contention.		68.6 56.6; 69.6 54.8; 77.6 54.8; 77.0 63.2; 73.8 63.0; 69.6 62.2; 68.8 60.6	
				Drop	Ionar	58.56, 14.28	Halls of Lightning	Group	TRUE	Phase 1	0	Deep in the dungeon, but has a high chance to drop 6-9 Airs.	61.4, 77.4		
				Mined	Titanium Vein	~	Any	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	4	Drops Air, Earth, Fire, or Water.			Metal, Titanium Ore, Titanium Deposit
				Drop	Whispering Wind	39.79, 52.85	Lake Wintergrasp	~	FALSE	Phase 1	3	Drop rates are pretty bad, plus they are in a mandatory PvP zone and pack a good punch.		22.6 65.6; 35.8 72.4; 45.2 70.2; 55.4 70.6; 62.4 74.0; 76.6 69.6; 79.2 81.0; 78.2 86.2; 55.0 84.4; 41.6 81.0; 26.0 74.0	
				Drop	Storm Revenant	21.02, 38.67	Sholazar Basin	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Spread out with two-thirds irrelevant mobs, broken up terrain, few spawns, relevant to dailies.		21.0 47.2; 23.4 36.0; 24.8 32.6; 28.8 31.6; 31.6 28.2; 31.8 30.2; 22.8 45.2	
				Drop	Lightning Sentry	75.43, 60.60	Grizzly Hills	~	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Plentiful in compact area, but bad drops and very dangerous due to their 500 dps lightning totems. Avoid.		73.2 51.4; 75.6 50.4; 77.8 52.4; 80.0 56.4; 80.6 59.8; 73.4 61.6; 72.4 61.0; 72.4 57.0	
			Crystallized Earth												
				Drop	Lifeblood Elemental	30.41, 44.79	Sholazar Basin	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Hyperspawn, the terrain isn't too bad if you start at the top and go down.		68.6 54.0; 74.4 55.2; 75.0 56.0; 74.0 59.4; 72.0 61.2; 66.6 63.4; 64.8 59.8	
				Mined	Any ore deposit	~	Any	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	3	Simply mining deposits has a very high chance of getting Motes, giving more the higher level the deposit is. I expect this will inject a lot of Earth naturally.			Metal, Cobalt Ore; Metal, Saronite Ore; Metal, Titanium Ore, Titanium Deposit
				Drop	Earthbound Revenant	39.38, 47.24	Lake Wintergrasp	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Only visible if your faction holds Wintergrasp. Drop rates are pretty bad, plus they are in a mandatory PvP zone and pack a good punch.		37.2 29.8; 43.6 47.4; 41.4 50.4|53.8 49.0; 57.6 41.2; 59.8 49.2|60.2 31.0; 65.4 23.6; 69.8 27.6; 64.2 32.0|59.8 59.2;61.0 66.8; 56.2 60.2	
				Mined	Any minable NPC	~	Any	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Reason number 2 why paying a miner for Earth is secretly the best farming technique. Higher-level and elite mobs drop more, but it's all about equal.			Metal
				Drop	Iron Rune Golem, Rampaging Earth Elemental	84.00, 86.11	Howling Fjord	~	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Do not fight on the scaffolding where many iron dwarves will fight the elementals and you. Instead be down in the plain or in the cave where there is nothing but concentrated Earth droppers. Golems have better drops than Elementals but both are good.		71.2 69.6; 73.0 69.4; 73.6 73.6; 71.2 73.6	
				Drop	Runic Battle Golem	76.25, 48.36	Grizzly Hills	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Plenty in a small area and about 80% are engaged with friendly earthen dwarves that will not kill them.		62.4 23.4; 64.6 19.8; 64.6 19.8; 66.0 23.2; 65.6 25.0; 64.0 27.0	
				Drop	Brittle Revenant	69.11, 30.50	Storm Peaks	~	FALSE	Phase 1	3	Relevant to a Sons of Hodir daily. Plenty in a small area, but high level and bad odds.		69.0 57.0; 70.8 56.8; 71.8 62.8; 70.2 62.8; 69.2 61.8	
				Drop	Sholazar Guardian	33.60, 43.46	Sholazar Basin	~	TRUE	Phase 1	2	Very quick respawns and a total of 10 mobs in the area, though in an indoors tunnel and sharing space with the elite Overlook Sentry. Quest-relevant. Plausible hyperspawn.		80.2 53.4; 88.8 52.4; 89.0 52.8; 88.2 53.8; 80.2 55.8	
				Drop	Guardian of Zim'Rhuk	70.26, 39.07	Zul'Drak	~	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Decent odds of up to 4 Crystallized Earth, but only 10 in a small area. Plausible hyperspawn.		60.4 40.2; 60.4 44.6; 59.4 48.0; 58.4 46.4; 58.0 44.8	
				Drop	Runic War Golem	75.43, 60.60	Grizzly Hills	~	FALSE	Phase 1	2	If you can fly, you can mostly fight only golems, otherwise a lot of stuff is in the way. Plausible Hyperspawn.		76.2 53.4; 77.8 59.0; 80.6 60.0; 75.6 64.2; 73.8 59.8	
				Drop	Chilled Earth Elemental	39.38, 47.24	Lake Wintergrasp	~	FALSE	Phase 1	3	Drop rates are pretty bad, plus they are in a mandatory PvP zone and pack a good punch.		64.5, 23.6; 66.7, 24.7; 66.9, 30.3; 65.1, 32.6; 58.6, 32.0|71.2, 53.2; 71.8, 56.2; 69.6, 55.3|56.2, 57.0; 62.2, 57.3; 58.8, 60.7|58.9, 38.5; 62.2, 50.2; 52.8, 48.3; 51.7, 44.5; 53.0, 37.5| 42.3, 45.8; 45.1, 47.1; 43.9, 50.0; 40.1, 50.5|36.4, 30.8; 38.5, 28.9; 42.1, 28.7; 41.4, 31.3; 38.5, 31.5	
				Drop	Perch Guardian	21.97, 39.48	Sholazar Basin	~	TRUE	Phase 1	1	Seven total spawns in specific spots with bad drop odds.	27.6 37.8		
				Drop	Overlook Sentry	33.60, 43.46	Sholazar Basin	~	TRUE	Phase 1	1	A single elite patrols in a circle where Sholazar Guardians may be found. Even if someone is questing, they are unlikely to kill it. But bad drops.	84.6 54.2		
				Drop	Stormwatcher	21.02, 38.67	Sholazar Basin	~	TRUE	Phase 1	1	I was able to spot a total of four intermixed with air and water elementals. Not worth doing.		25.6 33.0; 28.2 31.2; 26.2 37.0; 21.8 45.2; 23.6 36.6	
				Drop	The Anvil	75.43, 60.60	Grizzly Hills	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Quest-relevant in a building surrounded by iron dwarves, tougher than normal elites of his level, and has a friend. Not meant to be killed normally.	76.6 63.6		
			Crystallized Fire												
				Drop	Wailing Winds	65.91, 21.42	Storm Peaks	~	TRUE	Phase 1	1	Hyperspawn, bundled together in a tiny cave. A quest takes place there but does not involve them directly. Yes, they drop fire, not air.	61.6 39.8		
				Drop	Raging Boiler	19.52, 52.03	Borean Tundra	~	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Hyperspawn, compact, easy to kill		42.0 8.2; 45.4 6.8; 46.0 7.4; 46.0 10.6; 44.4 11.6; 42.2 9.8	
				Drop	Seething Revenant	69.11, 30.50	Storm Peaks	~	TRUE	Phase 1	3	Relevant to a Sons of Hodir daily. Plenty in a small area, but high level and bad odds. You will be phased out of seeing these for some time between the initial quests and unlocking their related daily.		71.0 56.0; 71.8 58.8; 71.6 60.6; 77.6 62.6; 76.6 63.6; 68.2 63.4; 69.2 58.0	
				Mined	Titanium Vein	~	Any	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	3	Passive income like Motes of Earth. Important: Mining anything but these does not give any Fire, including mining mobs.			Metal, Titanium Ore, Titanium Deposit
				Drop	Flame Revenant	41.70, 50.60	Lake Wintergrasp	~	FALSE	Phase 1	4	Only visible if your faction holds Wintergrasp. Drop rates are pretty bad, plus they are in a mandatory PvP zone and pack a good punch. There are three total spawns of these up at once.		83.0 69.0; 85.6 68.8; 85.6 73.8; 82.4 74.0	
				Drop	Unbound Firestorm	58.56, 14.28	Halls of Lightning	Group	TRUE	Phase 1	0	The dungeon contains a fair amount of these and while the odds aren't amazing, it's an okay source per run.		41.8, 12.4; 52,4, 11.5; 52.7, 30.3; 41.0, 30.1	
				Drop	Raging Flame	41.70, 50.60	Lake Wintergrasp	~	FALSE	Phase 1	3	Drop rates are pretty bad, plus they are in a mandatory PvP zone and pack a good punch.		84.0 64.6; 87.0 65.2; 86.6 73.6; 83.2 75.6; 81.6 73.4; 84.6 67.6	
				Drop	Lord Everblaze	53.94, 47.24	Crystalsong Forest	~	TRUE	Phase 1?	3	One of three possible dailies at the tournament is to kill him, and his drop chances are terrible. Don't.	54.6 74.8		
			Crystallized Life												
				Gathered	Any herb	~	Any	Herbalism	FALSE	Phase 1	3	Like with Earth and miners, the best source of these are herbalists. They just passively generate them.			Herb
				Drop	Thornvine Creeper	75.30, 71.52	Howling Fjord	~	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Plausible Hyperspawn. I never ran out of mobs in retail. Very low level and thus easy to kill while sporting competitive drop chances. 		53.4 15.2; 55.4 16.4; 55.6 19.2; 53.2 19.6; 52.2 18.6; 52.4 15.8	
				Drop	Servant of Freya	25.03, 44.79	Sholazar Basin	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Randomly patrols through an area with many hostile beasts, but has good odds and no notable drops beyond Life and herbs.		54.2 48.0; 56.4 52.6; 56.8 54.6; 52.8 62.0; 50.8 58.6; 49.8 50.6|41.8 53.0; 48.0 52.8; 45.6 57.4; 40.8 59.4; 35.8 60.0; 35.6 58.8|42.2 65.0; 44.4 69.0; 44.6 71.0; 42.0 71.6; 36.8 65.8|54.0 64.6; 57.0 65.8; 46.2 75.8	
				Drop	Mature Lasher	32.17, 50.91	Lake Wintergrasp	~	FALSE	Phase 1	4	Only visible if your faction holds Wintergrasp. Drop rates are pretty bad, plus they are in a mandatory PvP zone and pack a good punch. I counted thirteen spawns, however, making these not the worst source.		5.6 58.8; 10.0 59.2; 13.8 63.2; 13.0 64.8; 5.6 63.6	
				Drop	Living Lasher	32.17, 50.91	Lake Wintergrasp	~	FALSE	Phase 1	3	Drop rates are pretty bad, plus they are in a mandatory PvP zone and pack a good punch. One or two is next to each Mature Lasher, but they do not seem to be social.		5.6 58.8; 10.0 59.2; 13.8 63.2; 13.0 64.8; 5.6 63.6	
				Drop	Corrupted Lothalor Ancient	42.31, 63.87	Dragonblight	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Being below Living Lasher says everything. I only found three at once, and while they can be comfortably soloed, their net drops are barely above other life-dropping mobs. Only the ones not currently being corrupted (Symbols swirling above head) can be attacked.		32.6 59.0; 35.6 61.8; 34.4 71.8; 31.4 67.8; 30.4 62.2	
				Drop	Woodlands Walker	42.31, 63.87	Dragonblight	Quest	FALSE	Phase 1	2	IF you are on the quest, you can request they give you bark. This may have them attack you or give it to you and despawn. Since you only need 3, this is a very involved method for basically no gain over other farms.		32.6 59.0; 35.6 61.8; 34.4 71.8; 31.4 67.8; 30.4 62.2	
				Drop	Ancient Watcher	48.84, 42.85	Crystalsong Forest	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	There may be up to 3 up at a time, and they're not hard to kill. Their average drop is equal to other mobs, however. So don't bother.		31.0 38.2; 43.4 35.8; 44.6 36.2; 35.8 39.2; 31.6 39.8|17.0 27.8; 20.4 36.6; 18.2 35.2; 16.6 32.0; 15.4 27.0|22.8 45.4; 33.2 48.4; 37.8 57.4; 42.8 58.6; 37.0 58.6; 27.2 46.6; 19.6 49.0	
				Drop	Mossy Rampager	66.86, 43.56	Zul'Drak	~	FALSE	Phase 1	5	NOT a hyperspawn! Completing Pa'troll tends to require killing most of these, they are interspersed with annoying basilisks that are social with them, and their drop rates suck.		44.6 55.6; 45.6 61.4; 49.4 64.6; 43.8 70.6; 42.0 62.8	
				Gathered	Any gatherable mob	~	Any	Herbalism	FALSE	Phase 1	1	The odds aren't great, but it's a good bonus to killing them. Just about all of them also naturally drop life and have good odds to drop actual herbs when gathered.			
			Crystallized Shadow												
				Drop	Deathbringer Revenant	53.94, 50.19	Dragonblight	~	TRUE	Phase 1	1	Hyperspawn. Drop rates are about 0.2 shadow per kill. As it's inside of an alliance base, essentially needs flying to get to, but you're safe once inside the cave and you get to ogle at the former site of Frostmourne.	74.6 22.4		
				Drop	Shadow Revenant	32.11, 48.66	Lake Wintergrasp	~	FALSE	Phase 1	4	Only visible if your faction holds Wintergrasp. Drop rates are pretty bad, plus they are in a mandatory PvP zone and pack a good punch. I counted eleven spawns, which is quite respectable.		19.6 40.2; 20.0 54.6; 18.6 62.0; 11.6 52.6; 15.2 45.2	
				Mined	Saronite Deposit	~	Any	~	FALSE	Phase 1	3	Odds are pretty bad on regular deposits, but better on Rich ones.			Metal, Saronite Ore
				Drop	Wandering Shadow	32.11, 48.66	Lake Wintergrasp	~	FALSE	Phase 1	3	Drop rates are pretty bad, plus they are in a mandatory PvP zone and pack a good punch. Seem to accompany Shadow Revenants.		19.6 40.2; 20.0 54.6; 18.6 62.0; 11.6 52.6; 15.2 45.2	
			Crystallized Water												
				Drop	Boiling Water Spirit	19.52, 52.03	Borean Tundra	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Hyperspawn. The counterpart to Enraged Tempest and Raging Boiler. Concentrated, low level, hyper. Note the only difference between this and the following hyperspawn entries is navigability and difficulty-to-kill.		42.0 8.2; 45.4 6.8; 46.0 7.4; 46.0 10.6; 44.4 11.6; 42.2 9.8	
				Drop	Ice Elemental	78.70, 71.21	Howling Fjord	~	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Hyperspawn. Very plentiful in a tiny area and low level.		60.6 20.6; 64.0 23.0; 64.0 23.0; 63.2 25.6; 60.6 24.4; 59.4 21.4	
				Drop	Ice Revenant	52.78, 60.70	Dragonblight	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Hyperspawn. I don't see any way these are relevant to quests, but it may be something opaque. Still, concentrated, low-ish level.		68.6 50.8; 67.8 55.8; 66.4 55.0; 66.4 51.4	
				Drop	Frozen Elemental	34.69, 62.85	Borean Tundra	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Plausible Hyperspawn. They are simply so plentiful, spilling into Dragonblight, that even if they are not a hyperspawn you will have no trouble getting some.		83.4 45.0; 93.0 38.0; 91.6 41.8; 89.0 45.8; 85.2 48.2; 83.6 47.2	
				Drop	Frozen Earth	68.36, 40.81	Zul'Drak	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Hyperspawn. Seemingly higher odds than other mobs, though higher level, and still packed and isolated.		55.0 42.0; 57.0 43.0; 58.2 50.6; 55.8 54.6; 52.4 55.4; 49.2 48.6; 49.2 42.8; 49.2 42.8	
				Drop	Icebound Revenant	58.22, 30.30	Storm Peaks	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Plausible Hyperspawn. Themselves not quest-related, but guard a mob that is. As with Frozen Elemental, they appeared to hyperspawn in retail, and at any rate you will have no problem constantly farming while they are not overly crowded.		42.0 61.4; 44.0 66.0; 43.8 67.4; 41.8 65.8; 40.8 61.8	
				Drop	Crazed Water Spirit	65.50, 48.15	Zul'Drak	~	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Hyperspawn. Need to die in large quantities for one-time quest.		41.2 72.6; 46.2 80.6; 45.0 82.6; 42.6 82.8; 38.6 76.6; 38.4 74.8

Pull the chain pulling Vrykul to make the fire despawn. Run through and if possible, pull the second chain puller too and pass his fire. Then vanish. The first deposit is found in the tunnel after Prince Keleseth. It will be necessary to slay a bit of trash to get it, but it's all non-elites except for an elite patrol that can be killed alone or controlled.  Afterwards continue on. Beware the stealth-detecting dogs and randomly leaping Geists. Once on top of the stairs, find the second deposit in the tunnel there, which should be possible to mine while pulling only nonelite trash.  Soloing route: Kill stuff, skip Keleseth if you can't kill him (you should be able to skip him), make your way through. Note that you will have to clear a lot of the dungeon for two nodes, making this potentially unviable even if you can solo the dungeon.	24.5, 84.1
