# Northrend Crafting Almanac

## What is this?

A "simple" web page to display the data in my personal passion project which aims to catalogue all crafting
resources in World of Warcraft's expansion Wrath of the Lich King. Also to learn Svelte and refresh my knowledge
of Typescript, the frontend, and everything.

## How to run?

See package.json for available npm commands.

Make sure to `npm install` for dependencies first of all.

`npm run dev` will deploy the app in dev mode with hot reloading on localhost:3000.

`npm run parse` converts the data from `dataset.tsv` into `public/dataset.json`, which serves as the source of
data displayed by the app.

`npm run build` compiles the source code into a minified dist folder for deployment.

`npm run preview` deploys the dist locally on localhost:4173.

`npm run release` conveniently runs `parse`, `build`, and `preview` to make an up-to-date release dist.
